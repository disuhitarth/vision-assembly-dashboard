## 🚀 **How to Use the Live Camera Demo:**

### **Step 1: Open the Dashboard**
```
🌐 Navigate to: http://localhost:3000
```

### **Step 2: Start the Camera**
1. **Click "▶️ Start Camera"** button
2. **Allow camera access** when prompted by your browser
3. **You'll see your live video feed** immediately
4. **Camera status** will show "Camera Active" with green dot

### **Step 3: Watch Live Defect Detection**
- **Automatic inspections** start every 3 seconds
- **Red bounding boxes** appear when defects are "detected"
- **Defect labels** show type and confidence (e.g., "SURFACE_SCRATCH 87%")
- **Statistics update** automatically (Inspections, Defects Found, Pass Rate)

### **Step 4: Manual Controls**
- **📸 Capture**: Take a snapshot for inspection
- **⏹️ Stop Camera**: Disable camera feed
- **🛑 Emergency Stop**: Halt production (tests PLC integration)

## 🎭 **Simulated Defect Types:**

The AI vision system simulates detection of these defect types:

| Defect Type | Color | Likelihood |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Foreign Object** | 🔴 Red | High Priority |
| **Surface Scratch** | 🟡 Orange | Medium Priority |
| **Contamination** | 🔴 Red | High Priority |
| **Edge Defect** | 🟡 Orange | Medium Priority |
| **Color Variation** | 🟣 Purple | Low Priority |

## 📊 **Demo Statistics Example:**

After running for a few minutes, you might see:
- **Inspections**: 25
- **Defects Found**: 4  
- **Pass Rate**: 84%
- **Confidence**: 67-95% (realistic AI confidence ranges)
